<h1>The Best Movies According to Muhammad Furrukh</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies, anime and anime series of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Hajime no Ippo</h3>
<p>Best boxing series. Full of action and comedy.</p>

<h3>Ben 10</h3>
<p>Childhood memories and has cool artstyle with super cool aliens and powers.
I love all the series from classic to ultimate alien. Omniverse artstyle is a liitle goofy
but very intereting story telling. Hate the reboot!
</p>

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Literally the first anime I ever watched. Has cool OP, fun, comedic and wholesome moments.
It also taught a lot of important life lessons to me.
